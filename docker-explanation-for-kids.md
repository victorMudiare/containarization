# How to explain Docker to a New DevOps Engineer

### 🚀💫🎈 Hey there, tech enthusiasts!


Are you all geared up 🧗‍♂️ for a cosmic adventure to the world of **DOCKER** ?

Let's buckle up and get ready to dive into the universe of software! 🌌🪐

Imagine being a master builder 🏗️👷‍♂️ – not of boring old buildings, but the exciting world of LEGO.

You’ve crafted an awe-inspiring LEGO spaceship 🚀, with rocket boosters, glimmering wings, and snazzy control rooms. 🎮

**Wouldn't it be fantastic if you could pack this spaceship into a magical box 🎁, take it anywhere 🌍, and rebuild it precisely, anytime? 🔄⏳**

**That's precisely what Docker lets us do, but with software! 😎💡**

Think of your software application as this LEGO spaceship.

To help others build it precisely as you did, you create a blueprint, known as a **Dockerfile**.

**Dockerfile**, which is a blueprint 📜✍️ contains all the steps needed to assemble your masterpiece.

It's like the LEGO manual 📖 that you follow to build your set.

When you’re ready to build your spaceship 🚀 using this Dockerfile, you just need to use a magic spell: **'docker build'**. 💫🪄 Voila!

**Docker** transforms the **Dockerfile** into an **Image 🖼️**, a box containing all the pieces needed for your spaceship, pre-assembled, and ready to fly!

**Now, where do you store this incredible spaceship? 🤔**

Welcome to the **Docker Registry!** It's like a massive cosmic warehouse 🏭🌠 where all these ready-to-go spaceships (**docker images**) are stored.

You can **'push'** your spaceship 🚀 into this warehouse or **'pull'** 🚚 other ready-made spaceships from it.

Now comes the fun part!

Want to fly your spaceship?

**Docker** takes your **Image**, brings it to life, and it becomes a running software application, which we call a 'container' 📦.

Use the **'docker run'** command, and you're soaring high in the sky! 🌈✨

Sometimes, after a joyride, you might want to add extra rocket boosters 🚀 or a new control room to your spaceship.

With Docker, you can! Make your modifications, then use **'docker commit'** to create a new image of your super spaceship.

But what if your friend who doesn't have Docker wants to share the fun?

No worries!

The **'docker export'** command helps you pack your spaceship into a 'tarball' 🧶- a special box that can be opened on any computer.

Finally, when your spaceship has served its purpose, you can make space for newer, more amazing ones using **'docker rmi'** to remove it.

Just remember - Docker isn't just about creating software; it's about crafting, sharing, and soaring high with your creations.

So, are you ready to construct, share, and run your own spaceships? 🚀💖🌐
